        Hi, my name is Andres (most people just call me Andy) and I'm a Brooklyn-based software engineer, artist, and home chef. I'm mostly self-taught, but I've taken classes at the Art Students League of New York. I'm interested in art, coding, language learning, philosophy, technology, coffee, and cooking.

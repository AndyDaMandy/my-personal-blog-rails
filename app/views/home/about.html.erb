        Hi, my name is Andrés (most people just call me Andy) and I'm a Brooklyn-based software engineer, artist, and blogger.
        </p>
        <p>
        My tech stack includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS JavaScript/TypeScript, React and a little bit of Rust/Python. I'm proficient with CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind as well.
        </p>
      <p>
        I have experience in volunteering and have provided web services for non-profits. I'm currently open to freelance work and other potential opportunities.
      </p>
        <p>
        I'm interested in art, coding, language learning, philosophy, technology, coffee, and cooking. My fun fact is that I'm proficient in Japanese. I studied it in college and have been studying ever since. よろしくお願いします！

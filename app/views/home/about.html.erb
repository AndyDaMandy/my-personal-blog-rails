      <p>Hi, my name is Andr√©s (most people just call me Andy) and I'm a Brooklyn-based publisher, artist, software engineer, and blogger.</p>
      <p>I'm highly experienced in the Scholarly Publishing industry as a publisher and have worked with the scholarly publishing community of editors and authors for 5+ years. I'm happy to talk books (of any kind) and publishing any day of the week!</p>
      <p>I'm proficient in Japanese, with an approximate N1 level. I read, watch, and play a lot of Japanese media and am happy to talk about my experiences with Japan and Japanese culture.</p>
      <p>My tech stack includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and a little bit of Rust, Python, and C#. I'm currently learning some game development with Dragonruby GTK and Unity.</p>
      <p>I have experience in volunteering and have provided web services for non-profits. I'm currently open to freelance software development, art commissions, translation, and more.</p>
      <p>If you want to get in touch, feel free to find me on Instagram and send me a DM.</p>

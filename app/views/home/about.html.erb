        Hi, my name is Andres (most people just call me Andy) and I'm a Brooklyn-based artist, software engineer, and home-chef. I'm mostly self-taught, but I've taken classes at the Art Students League of New York. I'm interested in art, coding, language learning, philosophy, technology, coffee, cooking, and anything fun!
